I am a Ph.D. student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be mentored by Dr. [Yu Jiang](https://cals.cornell.edu/yu-jiang) at [CAIR Lab](https://cair.cals.cornell.edu/). Prior to joining Cornell, I earned my B.Eng degree in Agriculture Engineering at Zhejiang University. My research focuses on Robotics, Autonomous Systems, AI, and High-throughput Phenotyping.

My unparalleled emotional sponsor: Xunyu Luo.

The same imaging systems on them were also mounted on ATVs and deployed at Cornell AgriTech, UMN, SDSU, USDA-ARS (Parlier CA) and USDA-AFRS (Kearneysville WV). In each vineyard, the robots/imaging systems operated weekly in the field, collecting over 7TB of imagery data for downstream research.
