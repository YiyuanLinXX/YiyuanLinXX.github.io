I am a Ph.D. student majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ece/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am fortunate to be mentored by Dr. [Yu Jiang](https://cals.cornell.edu/yu-jiang) in the [CAIR Lab](https://cair.cals.cornell.edu/). Prior to joining Cornell, I earned my B.Eng degree in Agriculture Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) ([浙江大学](https://www.zju.edu.cn/)), where I was supervised by Dr. [Fei Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/liufei) at the iGE Lab for my thesis, and Dr. [Yanjun Cao](https://yanjundream.github.io/author/yanjun-cao-%E6%9B%B9%E7%87%95%E5%86%9B/), and Dr. [Fei Gao](https://yanjundream.github.io/author/fei-gao-%E9%AB%98%E9%A3%9E/) at the [FAST Lab](https://yanjundream.github.io/) of [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main) for my research intern. My research focuses on Robotics, Autonomous Systems, AI, and High-throughput Phenotyping.

- 2025/09 — Two [PPBv2](https://yiyuanlinxx.github.io/robots/ppbv2) robots were successfully deployed in more than 15 vineyards across the Finger Lakes region from May through Oct 2025. The same imaging systems on them were also mounted on ATVs and deployed at Cornell AgriTech, UMN, SDSU, USDA-ARS (Parlier CA) and USDA-AFRS (Kearneysville WV). In each vineyard, the robots/imaging systems operated weekly in the field, collecting over 7TB of imagery data for downstream research.
