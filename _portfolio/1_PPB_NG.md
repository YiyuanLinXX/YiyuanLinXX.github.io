PPB-NG (PhytoPatholoBot Next Generation) is a field-deployable multi-modal robotic system designed for high-throughput phenotyping in specialty crops. Built on a compact mobile base and integrated with 2 hyper-spectral cameras, 1 thermal camera and 1 RGB camera, PPBNG captures synchronized hyper-specetral images, thermal images and RGB images under uncontrolled field lighting conditions. The robot is equipped with GPS-synchronized data logging and real-time navigation, enabling centimeter-level localization and geo-referenced data alignment in vineyard environments.

Key Feature:
- Multi source data fusion and multi-modal phenotyping
- RTK-GPS + IMU for autonomous navigation and precise georeferencing of each image frame

The platform is fully ROS2-integrated and designed for rugged outdoor operation in vineyards. Data collected by PPB-NG enables scalable, objective, and repeatable field phenotyping studies.

**We are currently optimizing the PPB-NG and trying to release the upgraded version asap, please stay tuned!**
