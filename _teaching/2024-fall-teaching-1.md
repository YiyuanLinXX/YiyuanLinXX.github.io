## Course Description

Introduction to models for random signals in discrete and continuous time; Poisson processes,
Gaussian processes, Markov chains, renewal processes, queuing theory, power spectral densities,
response of linear systems to random signals.

1. Review of probability
    1. Probabilistic models
    2. Conditional probability, total probability theorem and Bayes rule, independence and conditional independence
    3. Discrete and continuous random variables, PMF, PDF, and CDF
    4. Expectation and moments of a random variable
    5. Jointly distributed random variables: conditional distribution, conditional mean, correlation and covariance
    6. Bayesian statistical inference: MAP and MMSE
    7. Random vectors, jointly Gaussian random variables

2. Basic concepts of random processes
  1. Deﬁnition and description of a random process
  2. Important properties of a random process:
    1. Stationarity and wide-sense stationarity
    2. Independent increments
  3. Examples of widely used random processes:
    1. Discrete-time processes: i.i.d. sequence, sum process, random walk, and Binomial counting process
    2. Continuous-time processes: Poisson process, Gaussian process, Wiener process and Brownian motion
3. Markov chains, renewal processes, and queueing theory
  1. Discrete-time Markov chains: transition matrix, Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, stationary distribution, classiﬁcation of states, recurrence and transience, ergodicity and limit theorem
  2. Continuous-time Markov processes: transition rate matrix, stationary distribution, global balance equations
  3. Renewal processes
  4. Queueing systems, M/M/1 queue, Little’s formula
4. Analysis and processing of random signals
  1. Correlation functions and power spectral densities
  2. Response of linear systems to random signals
  3. Wiener ﬁltering
